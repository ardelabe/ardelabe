- ðŸ”­ I have a job as a technical IT support - so, I troubleshoot problems and sometimes code some script to automate some tasks. In april-2023, I've been promoted - now I am the manager of the IT team in Londrina's City Council.   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning working in government business - I make some projects that become contracts. I usually have to deal with some troubleshooting and network management now and then.    
- :heart: I love linux and python - I wish I could work more whith those things.  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, his.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: Altough I'm in love with coding, I just found it (2018) in my life. I have a degree in Law school, in a fine University. This degree got me a job as public employee - and in my workplace I changed from public contracts department to IT in 2017.
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: I'm taking a second degree, this year (2024) I'll get my degree in computer engineering.
