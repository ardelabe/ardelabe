- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m not working with code right now, I have a job as a technical IT support - so, I fix things - I do not code at work (yet).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some Java, I just read the Deitel handbook (Java: How to Code), I'm reading Clean Code and Clean Coder (Robert Martin). I'm learning about Linux too. In my workplace, sometimes I need to deal with some server issues - some of them are Linux - so, naturally I started to use it's distros (now I'm using Arch in my home and Manjaro at work). 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any beginner friendly project - I feel more confortable with Python, Java, C/C++, but whathever coding enviroment accepts me in, I'm in! Give me some XP, give me, give me!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Altough I'm in love with coding, I just found it (2018) in my life. I have a degree in Law school, in a fine University. This degree got me a job as public employee - and in my workplace I changed from public contracts department to IT in 2017, and never looked back.
