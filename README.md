- ðŸ”­ I have a job as a technical IT support - so, I troubleshoot problems and sometimes code some script to automate some tasks. In april-2023, I've been promoted - now I am the manager of the IT team in Londrina'a City Counsil.   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Linux and some data analisys in Python.   
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any beginner friendly project - I feel more confortable with Python, Java, C/C++, but whathever coding enviroment accepts me in, I'm in! Give me some XP, give me, give me!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Altough I'm in love with coding, I just found it (2018) in my life. I have a degree in Law school, in a fine University. This degree got me a job as public employee - and in my workplace I changed from public contracts department to IT in 2017, and never looked back.
